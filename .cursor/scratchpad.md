# Background and Motivation

The goal is to automate the process of turning specially formatted code comments (e.g., `// PR: ...` or `/* PR: ... */`) in a TypeScript codebase into GitHub PR comments. This will streamline code review by allowing developers to leave inline notes in code that are automatically surfaced as PR comments, and then removed from the codebase.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Parsing Comments:** Accurately identifying both single-line and multi-line PR comments in TypeScript files.
- **Line Mapping:** Ensuring the PR comment is posted on the correct line in the GitHub PR, even after the comment is removed from the code.
- **Automated Removal:** Safely removing the PR comments from the codebase without affecting other code or comments.
- **GitHub API Integration:** Authenticating and posting comments to the correct PR and file/line via the GitHub API.
- **Workflow Trigger:** Ensuring the action runs at the right time (e.g., on PR open/synchronize/push).
- **Testing and Validation:** Ensuring the action works as expected and does not introduce regressions.
- **Edge Cases:** Handling multiple PR comments in a file, comments in unchanged lines, or comments in files not part of the PR.

# High-level Task Breakdown

- [ ] **1. Define PR Comment Format**

  - Specify the exact regex patterns for `// PR: ...` and `/* PR: ... */`.
  - Success: Patterns are documented and tested against sample code.

- [ ] **2. Set Up GitHub Action Workflow**

  - Create a workflow YAML that triggers on PR events (open, synchronize, push).
  - Success: Workflow runs on PRs.

- [ ] **3. Implement Comment Scanner Script**

  - Write a script (Node.js/TypeScript) to scan all TypeScript files for PR comments.
  - Output: List of file paths, line numbers, and comment content.
  - Success: Script finds all PR comments in a test repo.

- [ ] **4. Remove PR Comments from Code**

  - Script should remove the PR comments from the codebase.
  - Success: After running, codebase has no PR comments, and all other code is unchanged.

- [ ] **5. Commit and Push Cleaned Code**

  - Script should commit and push the code with PR comments removed (optionally as a separate commit).
  - Success: Cleaned code is pushed to the PR branch.

- [ ] **6. Post PR Comments via GitHub API**

  - For each removed comment, use the GitHub API to post a review comment on the corresponding file and line in the PR.
  - Success: Comments appear inline in the PR at the correct locations.

- [ ] **7. Handle Edge Cases and Errors**

  - Multiple comments per file, comments on deleted/unchanged lines, large diffs, etc.
  - Success: Script handles these gracefully and logs issues.

- [ ] **8. Testing and Validation**

  - Add tests for the scanner, remover, and GitHub integration.
  - Test on sample PRs.
  - Success: All tests pass and manual review confirms correct behavior.

- [ ] **9. Documentation**
  - Document usage, limitations, and configuration in README.
  - Success: Clear instructions for users.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

## Task: Define PR Comment Format

**Regex Patterns:**

- Single-line: `//\s*PR:(.*)`
- Multi-line: `/\*\s*PR:([\s\S]*?)\*/`

**Test Cases:**

- `// PR: This is a single-line PR comment`
- `/* PR: This is a multi-line\nPR comment */`

**Status:** Patterns defined and tested against sample code. Ready for review before proceeding to the next step.

## Task: Set Up GitHub Action Workflow

**Summary:**

- Created `.github/workflows/pr-comment-bot.yml`.
- Triggers on: `pull_request` (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review).
- Sets up Node.js 20.x, installs dependencies, and runs `npm run pr-comment-bot`.
- Passes `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API access.

**Status:** Workflow YAML created and ready. Awaiting review before proceeding to script implementation.

## Task: Implement Comment Scanner Script

**Summary:**

- Created `pr-comment-bot.js` to scan `.ts` and `.tsx` files for PR comments.
- Added `test-pr-comment.ts` with both single-line and multi-line PR comments.
- Script outputs JSON with file, line, type, and content for each PR comment found.
- Test run output:

```
[
  {
    "file": "test-pr-comment.ts",
    "line": 1,
    "type": "single",
    "content": "This is a single-line PR comment"
  },
  {
    "file": "test-pr-comment.ts",
    "line": 5,
    "type": "multi",
    "content": "This is a multi-line\nPR comment example"
  }
]
```

- Script works as intended. Ready for review before proceeding to removal step.

## Task: Remove PR Comments from Code

**Summary:**

- Extended the script to remove PR comments from `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- Ran the script on `test-pr-comment.ts`.
- All PR comments were removed; all other code and comments remained unchanged.
- Verified by inspecting the file before and after removal.
- Ready for review before proceeding to the commit and push step.

## Task: Commit and Push Cleaned Code

**Summary:**

- Staged and committed the cleaned `test-pr-comment.ts` file after PR comments were removed.
- Commit message: `chore: remove PR comments from test-pr-comment.ts via automation`
- Awaiting user input before pushing to remote, as force push is not allowed without explicit permission.

## Task: Post PR Comments via GitHub API

**Plan:**

- Update the script to use the GitHub REST API to post review comments for each removed PR comment.
- For each comment, post to the correct file and line in the PR.
- Requires:
  - PR number (from environment or GitHub Actions context)
  - Commit SHA (from environment or GitHub Actions context)
  - GitHub token (from environment)
- Use `@actions/github` or direct REST API calls (via `fetch` or `octokit`).
- Test by running the workflow on a test PR.

**Status:** Starting this step. Will report back after the script is updated and tested.

## Task: Handle Edge Cases and Errors

**Summary:**

- Multiple comments per file, comments on deleted/unchanged lines, large diffs, etc.
- Success: Script handles these gracefully and logs issues.

## Task: Testing and Validation

**Summary:**

- Add tests for the scanner, remover, and GitHub integration.
- Test on sample PRs.
- Success: All tests pass and manual review confirms correct behavior.

## Task: Documentation

**Summary:**

- Document usage, limitations, and configuration in README.
- Success: Clear instructions for users.

# Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
