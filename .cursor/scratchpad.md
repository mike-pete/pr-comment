# PR Comment Processing GitHub Action

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a GitHub Action that automatically processes special PR comments embedded in JavaScript and TypeScript files. The workflow is:

1. Developer commits code with special comments like `// PR: some comment` or `/* PR: some comment */`
2. GitHub Action detects these comments and records their content and location
3. GitHub Action removes these comments from the code files
4. GitHub Action creates actual PR comments on GitHub at the same file/line locations with the original comment content

This allows developers to embed contextual PR comments directly in their code during development, which then get automatically converted to proper GitHub PR comments.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

After analyzing the requirements, I've identified several key technical challenges:

### 1. Comment Detection & Parsing
- **Challenge**: Accurately identify PR comments in various formats while avoiding false positives
- **Formats to handle**: 
  - Single-line: `// PR: comment text`
  - Multi-line: `/* PR: comment text */`
  - Edge cases: nested comments, comments in strings, comments in template literals
- **Solution approach**: Use AST parsing or robust regex patterns to ensure accurate detection

### 2. File Processing & Git Integration
- **Challenge**: Only process files that are part of the PR changes, not entire repository
- **Considerations**: 
  - Get PR diff to identify changed files
  - Handle new files, modified files, and deleted files appropriately
  - Maintain proper git history and commit attribution
- **Solution approach**: Use GitHub API to get PR file changes, then process only relevant files

### 3. Line Number Mapping
- **Challenge**: After removing comments, line numbers change, affecting PR comment placement
- **Considerations**:
  - Comments removal shifts subsequent line numbers up
  - Multiple comments in same file compound the issue
  - Need to map original line numbers to final line numbers
- **Solution approach**: Process comments from bottom to top, or calculate line number adjustments

### 4. GitHub API Integration
- **Challenge**: Create PR comments programmatically with proper authentication
- **Requirements**:
  - GitHub token with appropriate permissions
  - Handle API rate limits and errors
  - Create comments on specific file lines
- **Solution approach**: Use GitHub REST API with proper error handling and retries

### 5. Atomic Operations & Error Handling
- **Challenge**: Ensure consistency - either all comments are processed or none
- **Considerations**:
  - What if comment removal succeeds but PR comment creation fails?
  - How to handle partial failures across multiple files?
  - Rollback strategy for failed operations
- **Solution approach**: Implement transaction-like behavior with proper error recovery

### 6. Performance & Scale
- **Challenge**: Handle large PRs with many files and comments efficiently
- **Considerations**:
  - Large file processing
  - Many API calls for multiple comments
  - GitHub Action timeout limits
- **Solution approach**: Batch operations, implement progress tracking, set reasonable limits
